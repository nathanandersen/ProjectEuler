##Project Euler

This repository is dedicated to my solutions for Project Euler challenges.

```
I have solved 97 problems to date.
```

There are 3 subdirectories:

`/Solved` contains problems that I have already solved, and solutions are tagged with their runtimes. I have set a margin of around 2 seconds for most problems.

`/ImprovementNeeded` is dedicated to problems that I have solved, but think I could improve my algorithm/implementation on.

`/Unsolved` is dedicated to my active problems that are not yet finished.

`utils.py` contains useful functions that I have written that are used across problems.

So far, I have exclusively used Python in my solutions.
