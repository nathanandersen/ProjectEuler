This repository is dedicated to solving Project Euler challenges.

There are 3 subdirectories:
SOLVED is dedicated to problems that I have already solved, and solutions are tagged with their runtimes. I have set a margin of around 2 seconds for most problems.

IMPROVEMENTNEEDED is dedicated to problems that I have solved, but think I could improve my algorithm/implementation on.

UNSOLVED is dedicated to my active problems that are not yet finished.

utils.py contains useful functions that I have written that are used across problems.

So far, I have exclusively used Python in my solutions.

Note to self: when I change utils, re-copy it into all subdirs.
