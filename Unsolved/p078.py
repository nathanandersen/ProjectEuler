# Problem 78

# Given that the group on the end is of size n,
# every group to its left must be at least of size n.

# Could I do this with 2-D dynamic programming?

# For example, if we have a row of size 7, and we pick a final
# group of size 2:
# Then we look at entry (5,2) to determine how many ways we can order
# an array of length 5 with last entry at least length 2
