# Problem 357

# Note that for this to be the case,
# n cannot be divisible by any square number

# 100 million cannot be brute-forced.
# so these numbers must have some special property.

if gcd(k/f,f) is not 1, then false

Therefore the only numbers to consider are ones that are made up
of combinations of primes

The prime factorization of n must equal n in order for us
to even consider it

30 = 2 * 3 * 5
not 60
42 = 2 * 3 * 7
